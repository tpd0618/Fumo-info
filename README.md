# Fumo-info
 A collection of subjective fumo descriptions

https://tpd0618.github.io/fumo-info/ 

I've been collecting fumos since 2021, and currently I have lots of fumo knowledges while I was taking fumo pictures.(but not all fumos)
So although this is subjective, but I want to share my thought of most fumos. Pull requests(your opinions) are always welcome!
I do love touhou, and I did many touhou STG accomplishments.(UFO no shift+no bomb, UM no shift counterstop, etc) Touhou is forever!



... And how about playing shiren the wanderer 5? Well, joke.
